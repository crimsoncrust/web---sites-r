		<h2>Brett Varn: A story</h2>

		<p>Brett Varn has always been a man of mystery.  Born somewhere in Southern California, he lives his life one day at a time.  A rebel with out a cause, a man on a mission for who knows what, a true entrepreneurial spirit.  He crosses the world with out ever a concrete plan, but always an ideal.  To "live life to the fullest and to never except mediocrity." (Circa Brett Varn 2006)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
		<p>Brett graduated High School in 2006.  A stuart of all that is grand is what people thought of him during his time in high school.  Always there with the right joke, always there to help you out, and always there to drink a beer with. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
		<p>After high school he joined the Military, (forced by his older brother).  He joined to support his country.  And he joined to better his life.  He served 6 years in the Army Reserves, working as a multimedia designer.  He grew his artistic skills to new levels.  During this time he did numerous pieces of art. From self-portraits, to vast landscapes.  He did it all during this time.  It is really the beginning of when he started his artistic career.</p>
